# nim-press

A static website generator from markdown with boosted breadcrumbs.

It takes in a folder of markdown files and a layout.html to build the navbar and the website. See the provided files as an example.

The navbar is highly inspired by [XXIIVV's wiki](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/home.html). I highly recommand checking their stuff out!
